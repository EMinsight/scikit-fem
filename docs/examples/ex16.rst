Spatially varying coefficient
-----------------------------

This example demonstrates a spatially varying coefficient.

Legendre's equation in self-adjoint Sturmâ€“Liouville form is

.. math::
   
  ((1 - x^2) u')' + k u = 0, \quad (-1 < x < 1)

The eigenvalues are :math:`k = n (n + 1)` for :math:`n = 0, 1, 2, \dots`  The
conventional normalization is :math:`u(1) = 1`.

The x-coordinate for the spatially varying coefficient :math:`1 - x^2` is
accessed inside the bilinear form as `w.x[0]`.
