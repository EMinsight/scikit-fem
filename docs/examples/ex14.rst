Laplace with inhomogeneous boundary
-----------------------------------

Another simple modification of :ref:`poisson`, this time showing how to
impose inhomogeneous Dirichlet conditions with condense. 
The forcing term is suppressed for simplicity. The boundary values
are set as the real part :math:`x^2 - y^2` of an analytic complex function :math:`(x + \mathrm i y)^2` which is harmonic and so that is the exact solution through the domain.

This is checked quantitatively by computing the integral of the squared
magnitude of the gradient, by evaluating the quadratic form associated with the
laplacian at the solution; the exact value is 8/3.
