Poisson using linear tetrahedra
-------------------------------

.. note::

   This is an undocumented example. You could help us to improve it; see :ref:`contribute`.

.. note::

   This example demonstrates a number of preconditioners for iterative linear solvers, including from the external packages `PyAMG <https://pypi.org/project/pyamg/>`_ and `pyamgcl <https://pypi.org/project/pyamgcl/>`_, if installed.
