Conjugate heat transfer
-----------------------

.. note::
   This example requires the external package
   `pygmsh <https://pypi.org/project/pygmsh/>`_.


In this example, the forced convection example :ref:`forcedconvection` is extended to conjugate heat transfer by giving a finite thickness and thermal conductivity to one of the walls.

The example is modified to a configuration for which there is a fully developed solution which can be found in closed form: given a uniform (but possibly different) heat flux over each of the walls, the temperature field asymptotically is the superposition of a uniform longitudinal gradient and a transverse profile (Mallinson, McBain, & Brown 2019).

In conjugate heat transfer, part of the domain is advectionâ€“conduction (like :ref:forcedconvection:) while the rest is pure conduction; the main difficulty is specifying different governing equations on different subdomains.  One way to do this has been demonstrated in :ref:`subdomain`: restricting an operator to a subdomain by only assembling it over a basis restricted to the elements belonging to a particular subdomain.
