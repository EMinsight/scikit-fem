Laplace with mixed boundary conditions
--------------------------------------

.. note::

   This example requires the external package `pygmsh <https://pypi.org/project/pygmsh/>`_.

Here's another extension of :ref:`poisson`, still solving the Laplace equation
but now with mixed boundary conditions, two parts isopotential (charged and
earthed) and the rest insulated. The isopotential parts are tagged during the
construction of the geometry in `pygmsh <https://pypi.org/project/pygmsh/>`_, as
introduced in :ref:`postprocess`.

The example is ∇²u = 0 in Ω = {(x, y) : 1 < x² + y² < 4, 0 < θ < π/2}, where tan
θ = y/x, with u = 0 on y = 0 and u = 1 on x = 0. Although these boundaries would
be simple enough to identify using the coordinates and
:meth:`skfem.assembly.GlobalBasis.get_dofs`, the present technique generalizes
to more complicated shapes.

The exact solution is u = 2 θ / π. The field strength is |∇ u|² = 4/π² (x² + y²)
so the conductance (for unit potential difference and conductivity) is
‖∇ u‖² = 2 ln 2 / π.
