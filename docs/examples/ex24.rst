Backward-facing step
--------------------

.. note::
   This example requires the external package `pymsh <https://pypi.org/project/pygmsh/>`_.

Following the example :ref:`stokesex`, this is another example of the Stokes flow.  The
difference here is that the domain has an inlet (with an imposed velocity) and
an outlet (through which fluid issues against a uniform pressure).

The geometry is taken from Barkley et al (2002); i.e. an expansion ratio of 2,
one step-length upstream and 35 downstream.
