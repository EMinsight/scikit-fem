Integral condition
------------------

This short example demonstrates the implementation of an integral boundary condition

.. math::
   
   \int_\Gamma \nabla u \cdot \boldsymbol{n} \, \mathrm{d}s = 1

on a part of the boundary of the domain :math:`\Gamma \subset \partial \Omega`
for the Laplace operator.
In this example, :math:`\Gamma` is the right boundary of the unit square
and the solution satisfies :math:`u=0` on the bottom boundary
and :math:`\nabla u \cdot \boldsymbol{n} = 0` on the rest of the boundaries.
The constraint is introduced via a Lagrange multiplier leading
to a saddle point system.
